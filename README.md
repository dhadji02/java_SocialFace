# Social Face

- This project was developed in the context of the mandatory Databases course offered by the Department of Computer Science at the University of Cyprus in 2020 
- _Social Face_, is a hypothetical Social Networking app, which allows groups of users to "interact" through an application that will be installed on their computer. The groups were asked to conceptually model the
described application and then implement it using Microsoft SQL Server relational database. Its implementation was done using Java Swing for the interface and JDBC for the database connection.
